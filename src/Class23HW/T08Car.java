Create a Class Car that would have the following fields: carPrice and
color and method calculateSalePrice() which should be returning a
price of the car.
Create 2 subclasses: Sedan and Truck. The Truck class has a field
as weight and has its own implementation of calculateSalePrice()
method in which returned price is calculated as following: if
weight>2000 then returned price car should include 10% discount,
otherwise 20% discount.
The Sedan class has field as length and also does it is own
implementation of calculateSalePrice(): if length of sedan is >20 feet
then returned car price should include 5% discount, otherwise 10%
discount
